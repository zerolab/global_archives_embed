# Global Archives Embed

The Global Archives Embed acts like a widget for [Threatened Voices](http://threatened.globalvoicesonline.org), a [TimeMap.js](http://code.google.com/p/timemap/) project that tracks threatened, abused bloggers around the world.

It is intended to make it simple to embed on any website in as simple a form as possible.

## Specs

The timemap will be embeded via an iframe that pulls the Threatened Voices data feed.

While Threatened Voices makes use of Timemap.js version 1.6 of the library, the embed will make use of version 2 which brings support for other map providers.
